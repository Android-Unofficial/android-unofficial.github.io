	<p>Within a week of Android 13's release, I have been hard at work for Google Pixel devices for their Android 13 bringup.</p>
	<p>Today I am happy to announce that the Google Pixel 2 devices have succesfully booted the latest version of Android thanks to ArrowOS.</p>
	<p>Of course, given the short-term release of this build, you are expected to encounter bugs, most importantly: </p>
	<ul>
	    <li>4G LTE/RIL</li>
	    <li>Permissive SELinux</li>
	    <li>You tell me</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As mentioned previously, these builds are not released for daily use, and are used for enthusiasts who are willing to support my work by providing some feedback on their experience.</p>
	<p>As always, if you encounter something new, feel free to use any of my links below to contact me either personally, or via the group conversations on Telegram that I take part in.</p>
	<p>A point worth mentioning, is that I believe in community work, and as so, all of my work is public on <a href="https://www.github.com/PixelBoot">Github</a>.
	<p>If you are enthusiastic about this new (not daily driven release), get your hands on the build below, and feel free to get in touch.</p>
