	<p>Monthly Update (January 2021), is now available for Google Pixel and Pixel 2 devices.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, as for the Google Nexus 6P, official PixelExperience support has been dropped, as it was too early to produce an Android 11 build for the public.</p>
	<p>The transition to Android 11 is well underway for supported devices.</p>
