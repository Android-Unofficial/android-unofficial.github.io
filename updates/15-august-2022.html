	<p><b>Android 13 is now live!</b></p>
	<br />

	<p>Android 13 has been released for Pixel 4/4XL, 4a, 4a (5G), 5, 6, 6 Pro, 6a devices, but what about the rest?</p>
	<br />

	<p>I'll be doing my part for the following devices to propose a possible upbring to the latest Android version:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Google Pixel 2/2 XL</li>
		<li>Google Pixel 3/3 XL (with ReallySnow)</li>
		<li>Google Pixel 3a/3a XL</li>
		<li>Google Pixel 4/4 XL</li>
		<li>Google Pixel 4a</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This transition will be easier for the devices officially supported with Android 13 (4/4XL, 4a), however I do thank everyone's patience when it comes for the rest of the devices, especially with the introduction of the 3a devices.</p>
	<br />

	<p>On that note, if someone is willing to pledge in for the 3a devices, with some help to testing on my builds, or donate his/her personal device to help improve the rate at which Android 13 is brought up, feel free to contact me.</p>
	<br />
	
	<p>You'll be hearing from me soon with regards to how the process is going, and I hope to collaborate with you soon!</p>
