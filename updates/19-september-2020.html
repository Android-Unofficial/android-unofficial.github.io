	<p>Dear Nexus 6P users,</p>
	<p>I am delighted to announce that the latest version of Android has finally been built for the Google Nexus 6P (angler).</p>
	<p>It wasnâ€™t an easy job, but finally, we have a bootable (but experimental) build of StatiXOS v4.0.</p>
	<p>If you are enthusiastic about this new (not daily driven release), get your hands on the build below.</p>

	<p>Enjoy!</p>
