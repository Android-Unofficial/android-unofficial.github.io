	<p>Dear Nexus 6P users,</p>
	<p>An updated about custom ROM support for Google Nexus 6P (angler), needed in order to let in more stable and popular ROMs.</p>
	<p>This is done due to the large amount of busy hours I have as of recently.</p>
	<p>Kindly excuse me if your ROM is going out of support.</p>
	<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
