	<p>Dear all,</p>
	<br />

	<p>I have been out of touch with this website for a while now.</p>
	<p>So here's a short overview to what has been and is in the works as of the current moment...</p>
	<br />

	<p><b>Google Pixel/XL</b></p>
	<p>Google Pixel 1/1XL unfortunately are incapable of supporting official PixelExperience 12 due to kernel limitations going against the 3.18 nature.</p>
	<p>In my free time, I shall be experimenting with the 3.18 kernel and BPF (https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/bpf) to provide unofficial support if successful.</p>
	<br />

	<p><b>Google Pixel 2/2 XL</b></p>
	<p>Due to the limitations of the Google Pixel's 2 system partition, I am currently in search for alternative methods to satisfy the preloaded Google apps shipped with PixelExperience.</p>
	<p>The new rules for official PixelExperience forbid the use of remove_packages to remove preloaded packages to satisfy the ROM's system partitions.</p>
	<p>I have been playing around recently with repartitioning, but this process will take long as I have already lost my original Pixel 2 due to too much tampering with repartitioning.</p>
	<p>Luckily enoguh thanks to a fellow supporter and friend, DarkPlayer, I am able to proceed carefully thanks to his kind donation of his own personal Pixel 2 XL.</p>
	<p>These slow measures will take place purely for safety of my and your devices, so your patience is highly appreciated.</p>
	<br />
	
	<p><b>Google Pixel 4/4 XL</b></p>
	<p>A new introduction to the family, is my own personal daily driver, the Pixel 4 XL.</p>
	<p>I shall be upbringing support to the Pixel 4 family thanks to the official support of PixelExperience.</p>
	<p>You might be wondering, why if you have a Pixel 4 or 4XL, why you would want to make use of such a similar ROM.</p>
	<p>Well for all of you, who are content with the stock experience but want a bit more freedom, in terms of customization and further source tweaks, then feel free to take a go at PixelExperience.</p>
	<p>Android 12 builds will be arriving shortly with official support to the Pixel 4 and 4XL devices.</p>
	<br />

	<p><b>Google Pixel 4a</b></p>
	<p>Alongside the Pixel 4's introduction to the PixelExperience family, I shall also take on the Pixel 4a.</p>
	<p>Due to similar kernel source, I found myself at ease when upbringing this device to PixelExperience, so much that the first official build is already up as of today!</p>
	<p>I shall be maintaining this device, as long as no issues occur for your enjoyment.</p>
	<br />

	<p>I hope I made things clear from my end, and I hope to progress on what is already moving steadily from my development. :)</p>
