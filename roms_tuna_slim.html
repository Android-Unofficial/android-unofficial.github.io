		<p>On SlimRoms i use all latest improvements applied on Unlegacy-Android.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>all carveouts reserved for Ducati (the multimedia subsystem of OMAP4, responsible for hardware-accelerated video decoding, encoding and camera functionality) have been switched over to CMA</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<p>A few words for those who see CMA for the first time:</p>
			<ul>
				<p><i>
				"The Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA) makes it possible for device drivers to allocate big contiguous chunks of memory after the system has booted.<br />
				The main difference from the similar frameworks is the fact that CMA allows to transparently reuse memory region reserved for the big chunk allocation as a system memory, so no memory is wasted when no big chunk is allocated.<br />
				Once the alloc request is issued, the framework will migrate system pages to create a required big chunk of physically contiguous memory."</i></p>
			</ul>
			<p>This means that a total of 996 MB physical memory is available to the system, while keeping Ducati fully working - this is a huge step forward, coming from the 694 MB available in the last factory image released by Google (Android 4.3).<br />
			While CMA was just recently implemented for this device, thanks to one of our developers (let's just call him Luden), it's quite stable: even under heavy memory pressure, the system manages to free up the required memory in order to start up Ducati and launch the requested multimedia functionality in a few seconds at most.
			</p>
		</ul>

		<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b>
		Patches for Android 4.4.4 and 6.0.1 are not provided by ASB (Android Security Bulletin) anymore.
		This means: security wise Android 4.4.4 and 6.0.1 are formally dead.
		Nevertheless there are a few enthusiasts, still backporting security patches from recent Android versions.
		You should know, such backports are no formal ASB security patches.
		Therefore the security patch level of this ROM is named as "Unofficial Security Backport".
