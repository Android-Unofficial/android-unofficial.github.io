    **April Update**

    Dear all,

    Apologies for not providing a summarized update for the last couple of months, but I assure you that lots has been going on :)

    **Google Pixel 1/1XL**
    With regards to the Google Pixel 1, to be completely honest with all of you who are enthusiasts, it has become very unlikely for any Android 12 support going forward from me.
    I have concluded this after countless hours of testing builds on builds for such devices...
    However, I shall keep contributing via fixes and sorts on recent unofficial PixelExperience builds found on my SourceForge and some minor bug fixes on official Lineage OS 18.1, on random occasions.

    **Google Pixel 2/2XL**
    On the other hand, loads of work for the Google Pixel 2/2XL has resulted in many positive results.
    As the situation was broken down, and the situation was eased thanks to the kind generous donations of both Pixel 2 XLs and Pixel 2s from around the globe, means that official PixelExperience 12 and even 12.1 stable has been familar amongst many of you interested.
    I am also delighted to express that for you smaller Pixel 2 users (walleye), PixelExperience 12.1 official support is now available via a new implementation for repartition, similar to what you can find on the Pixel 2 XL.
    So far, I have been made aware of some minor bugs, which I've been able to fix quite easily and quickly, however if you ever encounter any more, kindly contact me.
    Apart from PixelExperience support, I have also been able to bringup PixelOS for the Pixel 2XL which consists of Google Play System Updates and some other goodies!

    **Google Pixel 4/4XL**
    A strong start to the support of the 4th generation Pixel meant that users begging for a good ROM for tinkering similar to the stock Google experience, with a few extra goodies, have found themselves at home.
    Bugs have been cleared throughout the weeks and many positive constructive feedback was included by many of you using the ROM.

    **Google Pixel 4a**
    Similarly to what I stated with regards to the Pixel 4 series, applies to the 4a device too!
    A battery issue was spotted initially, however that has been quickly cleared up by me and the PixelExperience team to provide a long lasting ROM experience amongst PixelExperience 12 users.

    We are hoping that this support has benefited you users in this category! :D

    **January 23rd Update**

    Dear all,

    I have been out of touch with this website for a while now.
    So here's a short overview to what has been and is in the works as of the current moment...

    **Google Pixel 1/1XL**
    Google Pixel 1/1XL unfortunately are incapable of supporting official PixelExperience 12 due to kernel limitations going against the 3.18 nature.
    In my free time, I shall be experimenting with the 3.18 kernel and BPF (https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/bpf) to provide unofficial support if successful.

    **Google Pixel 2/2XL**
    Due to the limitations of the Google Pixel's 2 system partition, I am currently in search for alternative methods to satisfy the preloaded Google apps shipped with PixelExperience.
    The new rules for official PixelExperience forbid the use of remove_packages to remove preloaded packages to satisfy the ROM's system partitions.
    I have been playing around recently with repartitioning, but this process will take long as I have already lost my original Pixel 2 due to too much tampering with repartitioning.
    Luckily enoguh thanks to a fellow supporter and friend, DarkPlayer, I am able to proceed carefully thanks to his kind donation of his own personal Pixel 2 XL.
    These slow measures will take place purely for safety of my and your devices, so your patience is highly appreciated.

    **Google Pixel 4/4XL**
    A new introduction to the family, is my own personal daily driver, the Pixel 4XL.
    I shall be upbringing support to the Pixel 4 family thanks to the official support of PixelExperience.
    You might be wondering, why if you have a Pixel 4 or 4XL, why you would want to make use of such a similar ROM.
    Well for all of you, who are content with the stock experience but want a bit more freedom, in terms of customization and further source tweaks, then feel free to take a go at PixelExperience.
    Android 12 builds will be arriving shortly with official support to the Pixel 4 and 4XL devices.

    **Google Pixel 4a**
    Alongside the Pixel 4's introduction to the PixelExperience family, I shall also take on the Pixel 4a.
    Due to similar kernel source, I found myself at ease when upbringing this device to PixelExperience, so much that the first official build is already up as of today!
    I shall be maintaining this device, as long as no issues occur for your enjoyment.

    I hope I made things clear from my end, and I hope to progress on what is already moving steadily from my development. :)

    **Future ROM support (angler)**

    <img src="./assets/img/news/jly2020.png"/>

    Dear angler users,
    
    An updated about custom ROM support for Google Nexus 6P (angler), needed in order to let in more stable and popular ROMs.
    
    This is done due to the large amount of busy hours I have as of recently.
    
    Kindly excuse me if your ROM is going out of support.
    
    Thanks in advance.
